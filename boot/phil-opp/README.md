# OS in Rust (Phil-Opp)

This is most about Phil_Op's OS in Rust: [master branch](https://github.com/phil-opp/blog_os) @github, and the [log series](https://os.phil-opp.com), and the [first edition](https://os.phil-opp.com/first-edition).

[A minimal Multiboot Kernel](https://os.phil-opp.com/multiboot-kernel/) and [Entering Long Mode](https://os.phil-opp.com/entering-longmode/) in the first edition is generally helpful as they are indepedent from Rust. The similar content is also in the *[book](https://intermezzos.github.io/book/)* from [intermezzOS](https://github.com/intermezzOS/book).

[Post 2](https://travis-ci.org/phil-opp/blog_os.svg?branch=post_2) @github  from phil-opp is the source code I've read and compiled.
